Upped the hab multiplier of the viewing cupola to compensate for it having no crew capacity
slight decrease in cupola EC usage
The three Nom O Matics have been returned to purely Agroponics roles due to disparities with mass and volume when switching roles (i.e. they made for really heavy greenhouses when they should not have been).

------------------
Fixed an issue where there UI was corrupted on space center view
Corrected mass of the small radial recycler (0.6t down to 0.1t)
Fixed node issues with small cupolas and the small greenhouse

0.5.0 - (KSP 1.2)
------------------
The Nom-O-Matics have been deprecated for improved models.  They have been moved to a LEGACY folder to prevent breaking existing saves, though they may not have textures.  This folder will be deleted with the next KSP release.
The new Nom-O-Matics can operate in three modes: 
 - As a Converter (Mulch+Fertilizer=Supplies)
 - As a Recycler (using a biological filter)
 - As a Hab Multiplier (By repurposing the hab as an indoor mini-park with pretty plants)
Switching modes after launch will cost 1,000 EC and 200 supplies, and is an EVA action performed by an engineer.
The two radial Nom-O-Matics have been replaced by new, more stock-alike models
In Habitation Multipler mode, EC is still consumed to keep the units operational
Recycler EC cost has been increased (Be sure to check the tooptips)
Fixed an issue in persisting configs that may have resulted in corrupted life support settings, so be sure to recheck these in space center view and re-save.
Fixed a node issue on the inline greenhouse
All life support items now appear in a new 'Life Support' category.
Added a mini cupola with a corresponding hab bonus.
Less hobbit-like Kerbals.  The default supply consumption has been adjusted slightly downward (from 16.2 per day to 10.8 per day) - no more second breakfasts.  To adjust for this, change per second consumption to 0.0005 from 0.00075 in the GUI.
Crew capacity only results in a 7.5 day hab bonus as opposed to 30 days.  This is being done to keep things balanced with dedicated habitation parts, which will have more space but less mass.
WIth the inclusion of switchable parts, stock adjustments have been rebalanced.
- The crewed lab is now a less efficient recycler (50% for 4 Kerbals) to reflect most of its capacity being devoted to being, well, a science lab.
- The Hitchhiker gets a buff to its hab extension
- The Cupola gets a buff to its hab multiplier as well as a hab extension bonus

0.4.4 - (KSP 1.1.3)

EC can now be configured independently of supplies.  For existing saves, if you see any NaNs just open your config settings in the space center scene and save.
